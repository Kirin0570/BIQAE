# BIQAE

## Description

Repository for the source code and simulation scripts of our research paper titled "Harnessing Bayesian Statistics to Accelerate Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation".

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows to facilitate ease of use and understanding of the codebase: 
- `demos/` - Contains the demo notebook for the algorithm.
- `src/` - Contains all algorithmic implementation code.
  - `biae.py` - Main algorithm implementation.
- `simulations/` - Contains all code and results of simulations.
  - `numerical/` - Contains the simulation for quantum sample complexity scaling analysis.
  - `molecule/` - Contains the simulation for molecular ground-state energy estimation.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview of the project and repository structure.
- `biqae_simulation_doc.pdf` â€“ Documentation of the simulations.
- `requirements.txt` - Contains the dependencies for the project.
